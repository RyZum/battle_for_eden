Units played during combat don't simply add strength to their side.
    They also have abilities that greatly impact how the battle unfolds.
    Those abilities can be permanent abilities or triggered abilities.

- Permanent abilities are additional rules to the battle that take effect as long as the unit possessing this ability is participating in combat.
    For example, "This unit cannt be destroyed" and "+2 strength when wounded" are permanent abilities.

- Triggered abilities are effects that can be activated once by the player at specific times.
    The player can always choose not to trigger an ability.
    There are 4 types of triggered abilities:
        Immediate abilities may be triggered just after the unit has been played.
        Delayed abilities may be triggered when all units have been played, before determining the strength of each side. The attacking units' delayed abilities are triggered first.
        Reaction abilities may be triggered each time a specific event occurs (for example: "when an enemy unit is destroyed"). Reaction abilities of the form "when [condition]: [effect]" may be played when the unit comes into play if the condition is met, and each time the condition becomes met.
        Aftermath abilities may be triggered after the battle, during the aftermath.
