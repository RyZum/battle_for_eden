Units played during combat don't simply add strength to their side.
    They also have abilities that greatly impact how the battle unfolds.
    Those abilities can be permanent abilities or triggered abilities.

- Permanent abilities are additional rules to the battle that take effect as long as the unit possessing this ability is participating in combat.
    For example, "This unit cannt be destroyed" and "+2 strength when wounded" are permanent abilities.

- Triggered abilities are effects that can be activated once by the player at specific times.
    The player can always choose not to trigger an ability.
    There are 4 types of triggered abilities:
        Immediate abilities may be triggered just after the unit is added to the battle.
        Delayed abilities may be triggered when all players stopped attacking/defending, before the actual end of the battle. The attacking units' delayed abilities are triggered first.
        Reaction abilities may be event-based or condition-based.
            Event-based reaction abilities may be triggered each time a specific event occurs (for example "when a unit is destroyed").
            Condition-based reaction abilities may be triggered just after the unit has been played if a specific condition is satisfied (for example: "no cards in hand"), and may also be triggered each time the condition becomes satisfied when it was not.
        Aftermath abilities may be triggered after the battles, during the aftermath.
