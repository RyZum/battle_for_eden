Territories:

- There are territory cards in the central area at the beginning of the game.
    Players can attack those territories (wild territories) to take control of them.
    They can also attack other players' territories to steal them from those players.

- Territory can produce resources, which are of several kinds:
    meat,
    plants,
    ores,
    mana crystals.

- Those resources can be used to add cards to your deck, to boost your army or to make things harder to other players.

- At the beginning of a player turn:
    For each of his territories, he chooses a type of resources.
    Those territories produce the amount resources of this kind written on the tile.
    This is materialized by placing a corresponding number of resource tokens on the tile.
