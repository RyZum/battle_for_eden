Territories:

- There are territory cards in the central area at the beginning of the game.
    Players can attack those territories (wild territories) to take control of them, or attack other players' territories to steal them.

- Territory can produce resources, which are of several kinds:
    meat,
    plants,
    ores,
    mana shards.

- Those resources can be used to add cards to your deck, to boost your army or to make things harder for other players.

- Once per turn, a player can use his territories to produce resources:
    For each of his territories, he chooses a type of resources.
    Each territory has a number written on it for that resource, corresponding to how much resource of that type it can produce.
    Place as many resource tokens of that type on the territory's tile.
