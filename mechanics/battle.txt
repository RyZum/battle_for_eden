- During his turn, a player may go to battle.
    In this case, he selects any number of frontiers between his territories and other territories.
    Each of those frontiers become a front, where a battle will take place.
    The territory on his side of the frontier is called the 'attacking territory', while the other one is called the 'defending territory'.

- On each front, the player may choose to spend 5 resources from his attacking territory to give his army a +3 strength bonus on this front.
    Then, if there is a defending player on this front, he may also choose to spend 5 resources from his defending territory to add 3 strength to his army on this front.

- On each front, the attacking player plays a unit from his hand.
    Then, defending players play units from their hands to each of their defending territories' fronts.
    The attacking player and defending players take turns in playing a unit from their hand on each front.
    When a player (attacking or defending) has to play a unit from his hand to a front, he may chose to stop attacking/defending on this front instead.
    In this case, he can't play any unit card on this front until all battles are over.
    When both the attacking player and defending player have stopped attacking/defending on all fronts, all battles are over.

- When the battles end, on each front:
    If the attacking player had no unit, he lost the battle.
    Otherwise, the battle is won by the army that has the highest strength (in the case of a wild territory, the attacking army's strength is compared to the natural defenses of the territory instead).
    In case of equality, the battle ends as a draw.

- After the battle comes the aftermath:
    Doomed units are destroyed (i.e. returned to where they were bought).
    Other units are discarded (i.e. returned to their owner's discard pile).

- If the attacking player won the battle and the defending territory has a portal on it, that portal takes damages.
    The amount of damage taken by the portal is equal to the difference between the strengths of both armys.

- If the attacking player won a battle against a non-portal territory, he takes control of this territory.
    Resource tokens from the attacking and defending territories can be freely oved within these two territories.
