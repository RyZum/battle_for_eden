- Battle For Eden strongly rely on a deck building mechanics.

- Each player is attributed a faction at the beginning of the game.
    This faction corresponds to specific units, which only that player can add to his deck.
    A faction also strongly relies on a type of resource, or 'valuable resource' (it is battling for Eden because it wants this resource).

- Layout:
    In the center area, hexagonal tiles materialize territories.
    On some of those tiles, there is a portal, allowing a faction to come from their world to Eden.
    Also in the central area are cards and tactical advantages that can be acquired by any player.
    In front of each player are a pile of face-down cards called his deck, and a pile of face-up card called his discard pile.
    Also in front of each player are piles of face-up faction-specific units: the player's world.

- Faction-specific units are all composed of:
    8 basic units (cost 1)
    6 warrior units (cost 2)
    4 greater warrior units (cost 3) 
    4 tactical units (cost 3)
    3 champion units of (cost 5)
    2 immortal units of (cost 6, goes into discard pile if destroyed)

- At the beginning of the game, each player starts with an empty discard pile, and with a deck composed of 3 basic units and 5 lowest-value Crystal cards.

- The player then shuffles his deck and draws 5 to constitute his starting hand.

- During his turn, a player can do any number of actions, once at a time.
    producing resources (once per turn),
    going to battle (once per turn),
    asking for reinforcements,
    using resources,
    discarding cards from his hand.

- At the end of a player's turn, all players replenish their hands to 5 cards.

- If a player has to draw/reveal/discard more cards from his deck than it contains, that player must first shuffle his discard pile and place it on the bottom of his deck.

- Producing resources:
    see territories.

- Going to battle:
    see battle.

- Asking for reinforcements:
    A player can take units from his world for a total cost of X by discarding Crystal cards for a total value equal to or more than X and removing X valuable resource tokens from his territories.
    Those units are then placed into the player's discard pile.

- Using resources:
    A player can add a card from the central area to his discard pile or gain a tactical advantage by removing the corresponding tokens from his territories.
