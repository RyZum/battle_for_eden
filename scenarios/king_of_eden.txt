King of Eden:

    This scenario uses a figurine of a gigantic dragon (the King of Eden), an attack deck, and a D20.
    - the figurine will be used to represent the location of the dragon on the map
    - the attack deck will be used for battles between the players and the dragon
    - the D20 will be used to determine in which direction the dragon moves:
        18-20: forward
        15-17: forward-left
        12-14: forward-right
        11:    backward-left
        10:    backward-right
        9:     backward
        1-8:   the dragon does not move
        
    The game starts with the King of Eden on the Heart of Eden (facing any direction).
    
    After each player's turn, he rolls the dice to decide if the dragon moves and in which direction
        (turn the dragon in this direction then make it move 1 territory in this direction):
        - If the dragon should move outside of the map, it moves in the opposite direction instead.
        - If the dragon should move to a player's territory or portal, the dragon and that player go to battle.
            If it is not the dragon's first move, add 1 card to the dragon's hand and the player draws 2 cards.
            If the dragon won, it moves on the territory. Remove all resources on this territory, and it becomes a wild territory again.
            If the dragon lost, it does not move on the territory and stays where it was.
        - If the dragon moved, roll the dice again (continue until the dragon stops).

    During their turns, players can attack the territory on which the dragon is.
        In this case, they go to battle with the dragon.
        Add 1 card to the dragon's hand when it's defending.
        If it's not the player's first attack this turn, he draws 1 card and adds 2 cards to the dragon's hand.

    The game ends when either all portals have been destroyed (players' defeat) or the dragon has been killed (player's victory).
