\title{Battle For Eden Rulebook}
\maketitle


    Civilizations rise and fall across the multiverse.

    Meanwhile, a place is left untouched, never knowing magic or technology.
    Its peaceful fairy inhabitants live in harmony with nature,
    never knowing hunger or lacking anything, for it is a land of abundance.
    A land filled with all kinds of riches, a land filled with all kinds of resources,
    and above all a land filled with rare energy crystals: a land called Eden!

    When energy crystals become so numerous that portals to Eden suddendly open
    throughout the multiverse, it is time for civilizations to go to war!
    War for crystals! War for resources! This is the battle for Eden!



\section{Introduction}

    Battle For Eden is a war game involving conquest, resource production and deck
    building.
    Each player embodies a different civilization, and as such uses different cards and
    relies on different resources than other players, giving birth to an asymetric game
    with a lot of replayability!

    As civilizations discover Eden, they may face various situations.
    This game comes with various scenarios, each with its own victory conditions.
    Some scenarios will pitch players against one another, while other will have
    them cooperate to survive!
    Whichever scenario you choose, fight for the prosperity of your civilization!

\section{Setup}

    \begin{description}
        \item[Civilization choice] \hfill \\
            Each player chooses a civilization, and takes the corresponing
            \textbf{portal tile}, \textbf{occupation tokens} and \textbf{unit cards}.
            He then those cards in front of him as a pile, face up.
            This pile is called his \textit{\textbf{world}}.
        \item[Deck creation] \hfill \\
            Each player takes \textbf{5 Small Energy Crystal cards}
            from the corresponding pile and \textbf{3 cost-1 units cards} from his World,
            then \textbf{shuffle them} to create his deck.
        \item[Choosing a first player] \hfill \\
            Players decide who the first player should be.
            
            By default, the last player to have lost a game (of any kind) is the first player.
            By the way, you just lost the game. You know, \textit{the game}.
    \end{description}

    \begin{description}
        \item[Distance between two tiles] \hfill \\
            The number of frontiers one needs to cross to go from one tile to the another.
            For example, the distance between two tiles in contact is 1.
        \item[Discard pile] \hfill \\
            A pile of face-up cards (empty at the begging) besides a player's deck.
            Any player may look into any other player's discard pile.
            No player is allowed to change the order of the cards in any discard pile.
        \item[Discarding a card] \hfill \\
            Putting a card on top of its owner's discard pile.
        \item[Territory controlled by a player] \hfill \\

        \item[Territory fully controlled by a player] \hfill \\
            Territory controlled by a player and such that there exists a path
            between that territory and the player's Portal territory that
            goes only through that player's controlled territories.
        \item[Territory partially controlled by a player] \hfill \\
            Territory controlled by a player but not fully controlled by that player.
        \item[Wild territory] \hfill \\
            Territory controlled by no player.
        \item[Using resources] \hfill \\

            Destroyed common cards go into the corresponding piles,
            while destroyed unit cards go back to their World.
    \end{description}


\section{Map creation phase}

    The first phase of the game is the creation of the map.
    
    Each player takes one tile of each color from the game box,
    then adds to those a tile of the color of his valuable resource
    (todo: introduce term earlier?).
    He shuffles all those tiles together,
    and places them on the table face down as a pile.
    
    The Heart of Eden tile is placed at the center of the table.
    Then, starting with the first player, all players take turns building the map.
    Each turn starts by revealing the top tile of his pile and placing it on the map.
    A tile may be placed anywhere next to the Heart of Eden tile or to another normal
    tile, as long as it leaves the map in a \textbf{valid state} (see below).
    In cooperative game modes (or for a quick start), each tile is placed first,
    then revealed.
    
    At any time during his turn, a player is allowed to place his Portal tile
    next to normal tiles.
    It can be placed anywhere, as long as it is in contact with either two tiles
    (normal case), or three tiles (in which case, he removes one of those and gives
    it to a player of his choice who shuffles it into his tile pile),
    and that it leaves the map in a \textbf{valid state} (see below).
    A player that has already placed his Portal tile may also remove it from the map at
    any time during his turn.    
    
    A \textbf{\textit{valid state}} of the map is one in which:
    \vspace{-1.3em}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Every Portal tile is in contact with exactly 2 tiles,
        \item One can find a path that does not go through a Portal tile between
        any normal tile and the Heart of Eden tile.
        \item The distance between any 2 Portal tiles is 4 or more,
        \item The distance between any Portal tile and the Heart of Eden tile
        is 4 or more.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \vspace{-0.7em}
    If there is no tile left in the pile, a player's Portal tile has to be part of the
    map at the end of his turn.
    If it cannot be placed, he instead removes on normal tile from the map, gives
    it to a player of his choice who shuffles it into his pile, and ends his turn.
    
    The map creation phase ends when all tile piles stay empty long enough for each
    player to take 2 turns.


\newpage
\section{Main phase}

  \subsection{Beginning}
  
  	\begin{itemize}
        \item Create a pile of each type of common card,
            and place them somewhere where every player can access them.
        \item Place an amount of 2 in counters on each Portal territory.
        \item Players take control of the territories in contact with their Portal
        territory, and materialize it by putting Occupation tokens on them.
        \item Players may \textbf{manage their territories} (see below).
        \item Player draw 5 cards from their decks to constitute their starting hands.
    \end{itemize}


  \subsection{A player's turn}

    \hspace{-2em} During his turn, a player can perform several actions,
    which can be done in any order but not simultaneously:
    \vspace{-1.3em}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Discarding any card from his hand (any number of times)
        \item Buying cards (any number of times)
        \item Managing his fully controlled territories (only once per turn)
        \item Launching attacks on territories (only once per turn)
        \item Making a breakthrough (only once per turn,
        if a player-controlled territory was conquerred)
    \end{itemize}
    
    \vspace{-0.7em}
    At the end of a player's turn, \textbf{any player} whose hand contain less than 5
    cards \textbf{can replenish his hand to 5 cards}.


  \subsection{Drawing and discarding cards}
    
    During his turn, a player may choose discarding card as an action.
    In this case, he may discard any number of cards from his hand.

    When a player must draw more cards from his deck
    (whether to replenish his hand or because of a card's effect)
    or reveal more cards from the top of his deck than his deck contains cards,
    that player must replenish his deck before drawing or revealing the cards.
    To do so, he shuffles his discard pile and puts the cards under his deck.


\newpage
  \subsection{Resources}
  
    Territories may hold any number of resources (there is no upper limit),
    which can be of 7 types:
    
    \vspace{-1.3em}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Shards (white tokens)
        \item Plants (green tokens)
        \item Animals (red tokens)
        \item Ore (grey tokens)
        \item Positronium (yellow tokens)
        \item Omninutrients (brown tokens)
        \item Inhabitants (pink tokens)
    \end{itemize}
    
    \vspace{-0.7em}
    Resources on a territory are materialized by resource tokens.
    Counters may be put under resource tokens to count the number of
    resources of the corresponding type.
    
    Fully controlling a territory allows the player to use the resources it holds,
    as well as to produce or destroy those resources during territory management.
  
  
  \subsection{Buying cards}

    During his turn, a player may choose to buy cards.
    He may buy Energy Crystal cards (in-universe: refining shards),
    buy Tactical cards (in-universe: making use of the terrain)
    or buy Unit cards (in-universe: asking for reinforcement).
    
    Buying cards first implies paying a cost, by using resources and Energy Crystals
    (or only resources in the case of common cards).
    Once the cost has been paid, the card is put on top of the player's discard pile.
    
    \hspace{-2em} \textbf{IMPORTANT:
    Each civilization relies heavily on one type of resource, or
    \textit{valuable resource} (see the color of the cubes on their unit cards).
    As such, the only resources a player can use are Shards and his civilization's
    valuable resource.
    }


\newpage
  \subsection{Managing one's fully controlled territories}
    \subsubsection{Management}
    \vspace{-1em}
    Once per turn, a player can manage the territories he fully controls.
    For each territory, he can choose to:
    \vspace{-1.3em}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Produce resources (see below).
        \item Destroy resources: he removes half of the resource
        tokens of each type of resource on the territory (rounded up),
        \item Do nothing
    \end{itemize}
  
    \subsubsection{Resource production}
    \vspace{-1em}
      \hspace{-2em} Resource production works differently depending on the
      territory involved:
      \vspace{-1.3em}
      \begin{description}
          \item[Portal territory] \hfill \\
          No resource can be produced on Portal territories,
          \item[Normal territory] \hfill \\
          The player chooses a type of resource, and puts 1 resource token of that
          type on the territory's tile.
          If the chosen resource type is of the same color as the tile,
          he may put 2 token of that type instead,
          \item[Heart of Eden] \hfill \\
          The player adds an amount of 2 in counters on his Portal territory, and
          each other player adds an amount of 1 in counters on their Portal territories.
          The player may remove any amount in counter from his Portal territory to put
          as many new resource tokens (of any combination of types) on the Heart of Eden.
      \end{description}
  
    \subsubsection{Production capacities}
      \vspace{-1em}
      Some effects involve the \textbf{\textit{production capacity}} of
      a territory in a type of resource.
      In the case of a \textbf{normal territory}, the production capacity is simply
      the amount of that type of resource that the territory is able to produce,
      \textit{i.e.} 2 in the resource of their color and 1 in any other type of resource.
      
      In the case of \textbf{Portal territories and the Heart of Eden},
      their production capacities are considered to be 2 in their controllers'
      valuable resource types, and 1 in any other type of resource.
    
      \textbf{Territories outside of the map} are considered to have a
      production capacity of 1 in every type of resource.
      That is to say, if an effect is played on a tile on the border
      of the map and mentions the production capacity of the neighbouring tiles,
      the "missing" tiles are also considered to have a production capacity of
      1 in every type of resource.


\newpage
\subsection{Launching an attack}

    Once per turn, a player may choose frontiers between territories he fully controls
    and territories he does not control and start a battle on each of those frontiers.
    Each of those battles takes place on a separate "front"
    (see next section for more information on combat).

    Once combat is over, if the attacking player won battles on some fronts,
    he takes control of the corresponding territories by removing the Occupation tokens of
    the previous controller of the conquered territories (if any) and putting his own
    Occupation tokens on it.
    At that time, he may move resources as he wishes between the two territories on each
    side of the victorious fronts.
    
    \hspace{-2em} \textbf{
    IMPORTANT: winning on one front is enough to take control of a territory.
    }

    If the conquered territory was a Portal territory, the tile is instead destroyed
    (i.e. removed from the map), and all of that player's territories become partially
    controlled.
    The player who lost his Portal territory is thus effectively
    eliminated from the game.


\subsection{Making a breakthrough}

    If at least one territory controlled by other players was conquered during his attack
    phase, the attacking player earns the right to perform a breakthrough.

    \hspace{-2em} To make a breakthrough:
    \vspace{-1.3em}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item the attacking player replenishes his hand to 5 cards,
        \item the attacking player selects any number (possibly 0) of frontiers between
        those territories taken from other players and territories he does not control,
        \item the attacking player launches an attack on the selected frontiers,
        \item defending players (if any) may discard any number of cards from their hands,
        then replenish them to 5 cards,
        \item the battles are resolved,
        \item if this is the first time this step is reached and player-controlled
        territories were conquered in the previous step, the attacking player may choose
        to go back to step 1 (\textit{double-breakthrough}),
        \item the attacking player discards all cards in his hand.
    \end{enumerate}


\newpage
\section{Combat}

  \subsection{Attacking a player's fully controlled territory}
  
    \hspace{-2em} In the case where there is a single front,
    against a player-controlled territory:
    \vspace{-1.3em}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The attacking player plays a unit card from his hand on the front,
        hereby launching the attack,
        \item If he has not stopped defending,
        the defending player may either play a unit on this front or stop defending,
        \item If he has not stopped attacking,
        the attacking player may either play a unit on this front or stop attacking,
        \item Repeat step 2 and 3 until both player have stopped attacking or defending,
        \item On each side, sum the strengths of all units,
        The attacking player wins the battle on this front if the total strength
        of his units is strictly more than that of the defending player's,
        \item Post-combat phase (see below).
        \item Unit-destruction phase (see below)
    \end{enumerate}
    

  \subsection{Attacking a wild territory of a partially controlled territory}
    
    When a wild territory or a partially controlled territory is attacked,
    \textbf{there is no defending player on that front}.
    The battle on that front happens exactly as in the previous section,
    but as if there was a defending player who stopped defending in step 2.
    
    When step 5 is reached, the battle is won by the attacking player if the total
    strength of his units is at least equal to the distance of the wild territory
    to the closest Portal territory.
    

  \subsection{Attacking multiple territories}
    
    The battle on each front is similar to what is described above,
    but each battle take place in parallel:
    each step has to be performed on each front before going to the next step.
    
    The unit-destruction phase is shared between battles, which means that
    each player can only rescue one unit across all fronts.


\newpage
\subsection{Effects and abilities}

    Cards played during combat don't simply add strength to their side.
    They also have effects and abilities that greatly impact how the battle unfolds.
    A distinction must be done between permanent effects and triggered abilities.

    \begin{description}
        \item[Permanent effects] \hfill \\
        	Those are additional rules that apply to a card,
            like special buying conditions, ways to use it from your hand, 
            increased force in battle under certain conditions for a unit, etc.
        \item[Triggered abilities] \hfill \\
            Units in battle allow their owner to trigger their abilities at
            specific times, which are events that can have varying effects.
            A player can always choose whether to trigger an ability or not.
            
            Triggered abilities may be of 4 types,
            depending on when they can be triggered:
            \begin{description}
        	        \item[Immediate abilities]
                    	may be triggered just after the unit is added to the battle.
        	        \item[Delayed abilities]
                    may be triggered when all players stopped attacking/defending,
	                before the actual end of the battle.
        	        \item[Reaction abilities] may be event-based or condition-based.
	                \begin{description}
                        \item[Event-based:]
                        they may be triggered each time a specific event occurs
                        (example of event: "collapse of this unit").
                        \item[Condition-based:]
                        they may be triggered each time the event
                        "the card is played while the condition is satisfied" or the
                        event "the condition just became satisfied" occurs.
                        (example of condition: "no card in your hand").
                    \end{description}
        	        \item[Post-combat abilities] may be triggered at the beggining of the
                    post-combat phase.
            \end{description}
    \end{description}
    
    If several abilities can be triggered at the same time,
    they don't preempt each other and may be triggered successively instead.
    The order in which they are triggered is decided by the player that triggers them.
    If several players want to trigger an ability at the same time,
    the attacking player may trigger his first,
    then the priority goes to the one that plays after him, and so on.
    
    \hspace{-2em} \textbf{
    IMPORTANT: An ability of the form "\textbf{If} A\textbf{:} do B" can only be
    triggered if the condition A is satisfied.
    }
    
    \hspace{-2em} \textbf{
    IMPORTANT: An ability of the form "Do A \textbf{to} do B" can only be triggered
    if you are able to perform A.
    }
    

\newpage
  \subsection{Post-combat phase and unit-destruction phase}
    
    Some units'abilities allow them to \textbf{\textit{get rid of}} a unit.
    Units targetted by those abilities \textbf{\textit{collapse}},
    which means they are removed from the battle and put aside into a pile
    of \textbf{\textit{collapsed units}} until the unit-destruction phase.
    
    \textbf{During the post-combat phase,} various abilities may be triggered.
    Afterwards, all units that have not collapsed are discarded.
    
    \textbf{During the unit-destruction phase,} collapsed immortal units
    (i.e. cost-6 units) are first discarded.
    Then, each player may choose up to one of his collapsed units to
    \textbf{\textit{rescue}}.
    To do so, the player uses as many valuable resources as this unit's cost.
    Rescued units are discarded while all other collapsed units are destroyed.
    

  \subsection{Technical terms}
  
    \begin{description}
        \item[Allied territory] \hfill \\
        A front represents the battle on a frontier between two territories.
        The \textbf{\textit{allied territory}} is the territory on
        your side of the frontier.
        \item[Dooming and saving units] \hfill \\
        Some unit's abilities allow them to \textbf{\textit{doom}} a unit.
        At that moment, the \textbf{\textit{doomed units}}'s card is turned
        sideways to the right.
        All doomed units collapse during the post-combat phase,
        just before the other units are discarded.
        Some other unit's abilities allow them to \textbf{\textit{save}} a unit,
        which means canceling the effects of its dooming and making the unit
        undoomed again.
        At that moment, the unit's card is turned back to the left.\\
        Please note that \textbf{undoomed units cannot be saved},
        and that \textbf{doomed units cannot be doomed again}.
        \item[Producing/Using mana on a front] \hfill \\
        \textbf{\textit{Mana}} is a temporary resource that may be produced
        and spent during battle.\\
        \textbf{Producing mana} is materialized by placing counters besides your
        units of a front (your \textit{\textbf{mana reserve}} on this front).\\
        \textbf{Using mana} means removing tokens from your reserve on this front.
        At the end of the post-combat phase, all mana reserves are emptied.
        \item[Harvesting resources] \hfill \\
        \textbf{\textit{Harvesting a territory's resource}} is the action of
        putting on the allied territory as many new tokens of that type of resource
        as the harvested territory's production capacity in that resource.
