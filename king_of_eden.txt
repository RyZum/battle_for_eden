Concept: when the civilizations arrive, Eden is ruled by dragons
         their pack leader, the King of Eden, lives on the HoE
         the civilizations will have to defeat the King of Eden
         if they want to get this land resources

Victory condition: conquer the HoE before all portals are destroyed

Map creation:
 - the HoE is in the center
 - players each have 7+1 tiles as usual
 - they use 3 random tiles to place their portals at distance 3 of the HoE,
   then place the tile of their color in contact with their portal tile
 - they take turn placing random tiles on the map,
   but don't look at them before choosing the location
 - some map examples will be needed for beginners

Mechanics:
 - Dragons have their own territories, initially only the HoE
 - Starting from the 2nd turn,
   they participate in the expansion phase as the last player
 - There is a deck of dragon action cards to decide what territories the dragons
   attack during their turn.
   Initially, all cards of the deck are in the discard pile
   except 3 minimum distance ones
 - They attack using a deck of dragon cards.
   All attacks happen independently in an order chosen by the players
   When a player is attacked more than once,
   he obviously replenishes at the end of each battle,
   and is allowed to discard any number of cards then replenish between battles
 - The attack itself consists of 5 cards from the dragon deck (a hand),
   played a random order
   making the dragons discard a card discards a random card from this hand
   getting rid of a dragon unit discards it
   if the dragons must choose a unit,
   they choose the one with either the highest or lowest strength,
   whichever is most detrimental to the player in terms of direct strength
 - A player can support another player with whom he shares a frontier
   In this case, the supported player defends normally,
   while everything happens for the supporting player as if he owned
   the attacked territory and was the only one attacked.
   Then, to determine if the dragon won, the sum of their strengths over
   both battles is compared to the sum of the players' strengths
 - When the dragons conquer a territory, all resources on it are destroyed.
   If it's a Portal territory, the portal is destroyed
 - They automatically win against wild territories
 - When a player attacks the HoE,
   the dragons start the battle with the King of Eden on the first row
 - When players attack other dragon territories,
   everything happens as if they were wild territories
   with a defense equal to their base defense
   (materialized by counters on the HoE),
   which starts at 5 and increases by 2 during their turn if they were attacked
   during the expansion phase up to a maximum of 15
 - If a dragon territory is disconnected from the HoE,
   it is still considered a dragon territory for defense,
   but not for the action cards
   

Dragon action cards:
- 5x Attack on all frontiers with territories at minimum distance from the HoE
- 2x Attack on all frontiers with territories at minimum distance from the HoEx2
- 2x Attack on all frontiers with territories at maximum distance from the HoE
- 1x Attack on all frontiers with territories at maximum distance from the HoEx2

      (max 2 destroyed per turn)
- 3x  White Dragon
      strength 2, cost 2
      Get rid of an enemy unit chosen by the player
