- Game modes/scenarios
    cooperation modes
    nonplayble enemys
        attrition die?
        attack deck?
        in any case, random needed to make it dangerous
    ages to have event unfold progressively are good

- randomness (attrition-die like) for PvP? a deck for the enemy, with effects corresponding to the various effects written on the enemy cards? (in a quarriors kind of way)

- mechanics for alliances? for joint attacks? (does the defending player draws cards to compensate for the multiple attack?)

- symbols on cards instead of text?

- allowing players to continue attacking after a victory? both attacking and attacked players may discard cards, then replenish their hands to 5 cards. After the battle, the attacking player discards his hand.
