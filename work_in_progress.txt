- Blood Tribe:
 => Consistency of the faction? Role of the Blood Lord?
 => Strength of the Poison Master?

- Dwarves:
 => Artificer: increase resource cost of ability?

- Elves:
 => Magic Archer: ajust ability cost? twice the target unit cost?
 => Usefulness of the Mystic?
 => Spirit of Nature: Almost unkillable -> discarded at next mana production when doomed?

- Fleshless:
 => Usefulness of the Bone Golem?

- Kingdom:
 => Captain: reveal cards until 2 non-Captain units of strength 1?
 => Heavy Infantry: +2 strength only?


- Coop mode:
 => attack deck?
 => deck construction rules? /!\ it has to be slumbering at first, with few strong cards and lots of trash cards
 => exact rules for moving the dragon, exact winnin/losing conditions? (lots of victories needed to win, destruction of 1 Portal enough to lose?)
