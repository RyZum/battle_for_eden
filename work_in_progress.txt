- Game modes/scenarios
    cooperation modes
    nonplayble enemys
        attrition die?
        attack deck?
        in any case, random needed to make it dangerous
    ages to have event unfold progressively are good

- randomness (attrition-die like) for PvP? a deck for the enemy, with effects corresponding to the various effects written on the enemy cards? (in a quarriors kind of way)

- mechanics for alliances? for joint attacks? (does the defending player draws cards to compensate for the multiple attack?)

- symbols on cards instead of text?

- using resources to continue attacking ? how to have the attacking and defending player draw cards so that it's not broken?
